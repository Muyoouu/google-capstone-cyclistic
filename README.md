# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic the Bike-Sharing Company

This is an analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach, using Python and it's libraries. This analysis is a part of a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course. The subject of the analysis is Cyclistic, a fictitious bike-share company, yet backed with real-world dataset from a company in Chicago. The analysis was done on Jupyter Notebook, and here I intend to showcase the notebook in form of HTML page.  

Access the notebook through this Github Pages:
