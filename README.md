# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic - The Bike-Sharing Company

This analysis employs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach, utilizing Python and its libraries. It is part of the Google Data Analytics Course's capstone project. The analysis focuses on Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company, backed by a real-world dataset from a Chicago-based company. The analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook, and I am presenting the notebook as an HTML page here.
